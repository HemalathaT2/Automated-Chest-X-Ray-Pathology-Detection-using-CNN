# Automated-Chest-X-Ray-Pathology-Detection-using-CNN

Built a Convolutonal Neural Network (CNN) classifier to discriminate between 14 different pathologies from chest X-ray images using functions from Keras framework.
In particular, we have:
1. Pre-processed and prepared a real-world X-ray dataset.
2. Used a pretrained DenseNet CNN model and fine-tuned it for X-ray image classification.
3. Handled class imbalance.
4. Evaluated the model performance with test data.
